# Multiplayer Github Game

This is a multiplayer game built using Python and GitHub. The game allows two players to take turns and make moves until the game is over.

## Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `main.py`: The main file for the multiplayer github game.
- `game.py`: The game file for the multiplayer github game.
- `player.py`: The player file for the multiplayer github game.
- `network.py`: The network file for the multiplayer github game.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Usage

To play the game, run the `main.py` file. The game will start and prompt the players to make moves. The game will continue until it is over.

import game
import player

def main():
    # Create game instance
    my_game = game.Game()

    # Create player instances
    player1 = player.Player("Player 1")
    player2 = player.Player("Player 2")

    # Create network instance
    my_network = network.Network()

    # Connect players to the network
    my_network.connect(player1)
    my_network.connect(player2)

    # Start the game
    my_game.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
